				<h1>Seedling Life</h1>
				<p>The Decentralized Social Newspaper</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				The only way we can tackle global challenges is by finding like-minded people and mobilizing
				action. What if we combined the best elements of modern social networks and classic
				newspapers?
			</p>
			<p>This is the <span>Seedling Life</span> concept:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>🏛️ Organizations publish sections</b> of the newspaper, containing articles, events, listings
					and other content.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>👍 Follow organizations you care about</b> from local and global sustainability communities
					and networks.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>📰 Receive a personalized newspaper</b> printed and mailed to your home based on the organizations
					you follow.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>💸 Organizations get financed</b> by their subscribers, since subsrciption fees are split
					fairly between contributors.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🗓️ Monthly circulation</b> keeps the publication relaxed for everyone and ensures quality
					over quantity.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The hope is that deep engagement could be achieved by this combination of the flexibility
				and openness of social networks with the thoughtful rigor of the newspaper.

				<h2>Let's Make Nonprofit<br />Organizations Great Again</h2>
				<p>Stop Worrying About Funding<br />& Focus on Your Impact</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				Why is this concept interesting for the civil society? Fundraising for nonprofits is
				challenging, whether through grants or donations, its hard to keep a steady stream of
				financing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Good news everybody! <span>Seedling Life</span> is designed to help:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>✨ Physical newspapers engage people</b> making it easier to convice them to support you
					with donation.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>📈 Monthly subscriptions mean continuous funding</b> removing the stress and distraction
					of grant applications.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>💰 Subscription fees are not capped</b> allowing subscribers - inlcuding foundations - to
					donate as much as they want.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🌈 Joining forces is essential</b> since sending a newspaper alone is junk mail while sending
					it together is a movement.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Since the minimum it takes to participate in seedling is publishing two pages every month,
				there isn't much to lose. You can probably recycle the content from your website anyway!

				<h2>Engaged Citizens Deserve<br />A Simple Way to Participate</h2>
				<p>Real Civic Discourse and Activism,<br />Without the Social Media Bullshit</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				As citizens we care about a sustainable future, and about being part of a meaninful
				community. But the contemporary civil society landscape doesn't make it easy to participate.
			</p>
			<p>
				What could <span>Seedling Life</span> offer you?
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>🌴 Get unplugged but stay connected</b> with a relaxing monthly newspaper instead of daily
					social media binges.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🔭 Discover and follow communities</b> you care about in the local and global sustainability
					scene.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>📅 Keep up with events</b> with a personalized event schedule listing events from your favorite
					communities.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>📝 Engage mindfully</b> by writing thoughtful letters instead of reactive comments in polarized
					threads.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>💚 Give your support</b> with your subscription fees, which crowdfund all the communities
					you follow..
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Staying engaged should cause us anxiety. We shouldn't have to stay glued to a screen or keep
				track of dozens of donations to make a difference. Let's make participation simple!

				<h2>Printed Sustainably in France</h2>
				<p>Shipping included to Over 40 countries</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				I'm currently planning to print through
				<a href="https://www.printnewspaper.com/">printnewspaper.com</a>, a company based in France
				offering inkjet-based newspaper printing.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>🌲 The paper sustainable</b> and sourced 50% from recycled paper and 50% from sustainable
					forestry in France.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>✉️ Shipping to around 40 countries</b> is included, and I plan to figure out a way to ship
					to the rest of the world.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>⬇️ Prices are reasonable</b>, e.g. a 24-page tabloid shipped globally costs max.
					€3.10/copy starting at 2000 copies (tax incl.).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🖨️ Inkjet technology</b> makes personalized newspaper printing economically viable.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>⚙️ Automation is possible</b> based on tentative comments from the company's technical lead.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The company seems promising and support was helpful when I inquired about this concept. If
				there are issues, we could always replace or supplement their service with other printing
				presses.

				<h2>Sensible Technology for<br />Today as well as Tomorrow</h2>
				<p>Open-Source, Federated & Complient<br />Easy for Developers to Understand</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				A good tech strategy should be <i>progressive</i> enough to keep up with the times, yet
				<i>cautious</i>
				enough to avoid using immature technologies. It should also balance
				<i>ethics</i>
				with
				<i>pragmatism</i>.
			</p>
			<p>Here is an outline of my proposed tech strategy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>⭐ Open-source licensing</b> is a given - the project will be released under an open-source
					license, likely MPL 2.0.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🔌 Decentralized through federation</b> using the
					<a href="http://activitypub.rocks">ActivityPub Protocol</a> (endorsed by the
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>) powering the
					<a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🌐 Web standards complient</b> ensuring portability and accessibiity best practices and
					a sustainable technology
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>🛠️ No-nonsense stack</b> that is modern, proven, and easy for developers to grasp:
					<ul>
						<li>✅ Svelte/Kit, TypeScript, Supabase</li>
						<li>⛔ Blockchain, Esoteric Languages, Closed Dependencies</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				With this approach we hope to be able to develop with reasonable velocity while maintaining
				the kind of codebase we love to work with.
