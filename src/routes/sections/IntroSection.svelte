			<h1>Seedling Life</h1>
			<p>The Decentralized Social Newspaper</p>
		</hgroup>
		<p>
			The only way we can tackle global challenges is by finding like-minded people and mobilizing
			action. What if we combined the best elements of modern social networks and classic
			newspapers?
		</p>
		<p>This is the <span>Seedling Life</span> newspaper concept:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>🏛️ Organizations publish sections</b> of the newspaper, containing articles, events, listings
				and other content.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>👍 You follow organizations you care about</b> from local and global sustainability communities
				and networks.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>📰 You receive a personalized newspaper</b> printed and mailed to your home based on the organizations
				you follow.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>💸 Organizations get financed</b> by their subscribers, since subsrciption fees are split
				fairly between contributors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🗓️ Monthly circulation</b> keeps the publication relaxed for everyone and ensures quality
				over quantity.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			⚠️ Note that <b> this is an early stage nonprofit project</b>
			. I'm currently looking for 4-5 organizations willing to participate in a pilot program.
