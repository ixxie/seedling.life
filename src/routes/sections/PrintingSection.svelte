			<h2>Printed Sustainably in France</h2>
			<p>Shipping included to Over 40 countries</p>
		</hgroup>
		<p>
			I'm currently planning to print through
			<a href="https://www.printnewspaper.com/">printnewspaper.com</a>, a company based in France
			offering inkjet-based newspaper printing.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>🌲 The paper seems sustainable</b> and sourced 50% from recycled paper and 50% from certified
				forestry in Europe.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>✉️ Shipping to around 40 countries</b> is included, and I plan to figure out a way to ship
				to the rest of the world.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>⬇️ Prices are reasonable</b>, e.g. a 24-page tabloid shipped globally costs max.
				€3.10/copy starting at 2000 copies (tax incl.).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🖨️ Inkjet technology</b> makes personalized newspaper printing economically viable.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>⚙️ Automation is possible</b> based on tentative comments from the company's technical lead.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The company seems promising and support was helpful when I inquired about this concept. If
			there are issues, we could always replace or supplement their service with other printing
			presses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Assessing the impact of paper-based communication vs. digital communication is very difficult.
			Still believe digital is the way to go? We will offer the option to receive the newspaper in
			digital form for those who prefer it.
