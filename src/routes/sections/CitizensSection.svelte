			<h2>Engaged Citizens Deserve<br />A Simple Way to Participate</h2>
			<p>Real Civic Discourse and Activism,<br />Without the Social Media Bullshit</p>
		</hgroup>
		<p>
			As citizens we care about a sustainable future, and about being part of a meaninful community.
			But the contemporary civil society landscape doesn't make it easy to participate.
		</p>
		<p>
			What could <span>Seedling Life</span> offer you?
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>🌴 Get unplugged but stay connected</b> with a relaxing monthly newspaper instead of daily
				social media binges.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🔭 Discover and follow communities</b> you care about in the local and global sustainability
				scene.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>📅 Keep up with events</b> with a personalized event schedule listing events from your favorite
				communities.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>📝 Engage mindfully</b> by writing thoughtful letters instead of reactive comments in polarized
				threads.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>💚 Give your support</b> with your subscription fees, which crowdfund all the communities
				you follow..
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Staying engaged should cause us anxiety. We shouldn't have to stay glued to a screen or keep
			track of dozens of donations to make a difference. Let's make participation simple!
