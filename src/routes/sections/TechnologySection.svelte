			<h2>Sensible Technology for<br />Today as well as Tomorrow</h2>
			<p>Open-Source, Federated & Complient<br />Easy for Developers to Understand</p>

			A good tech strategy should be <i>progressive</i> enough to keep up with the times, yet
			<i>cautious</i>
			enough to avoid using immature technologies. It should also balance
			<i>ethics</i>
			with
			<i>pragmatism</i>.
		</p>
		<p>Here is an outline of my proposed tech strategy:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>⭐ Open-source licensing</b> is a given - the project will be released under an open-source
				license, likely MPL 2.0.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🔌 Decentralized through federation</b> using the
				<a href="http://activitypub.rocks">ActivityPub Protocol</a> (endorsed by the
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>) powering the
				<a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🌐 Web standards complient</b> ensuring portability and accessibiity best practices and a
				sustainable technology
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🛠️ No-nonsense stack</b> that is modern, proven, and easy for developers to grasp:
				<ul>
					<li>✅ Svelte/Kit, TypeScript, Supabase, Pandoc</li>
					<li>⛔ Blockchain, Esoteric Languages, Closed Dependencies</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			With this approach we hope to be able to develop with reasonable velocity while maintaining
			the kind of codebase we love to work with.
