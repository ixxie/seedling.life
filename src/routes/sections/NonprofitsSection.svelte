			<h2>Let's Make Nonprofit<br />Organizations Great Again</h2>
			<p>Stop Worrying About Funding<br />& Focus on Your Impact</p>
		</hgroup>
		<p>
			Why is this concept interesting for the civil society? Fundraising for nonprofits is
			challenging, whether through grants or donations, its hard to keep a steady stream of
			financing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Good news everybody! <span>Seedling Life</span> is designed to help:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>✨ Physical products engage people</b> making it easier to convice them to support you with
				donation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>📈 Monthly subscriptions mean continuous funding</b> removing the stress and distraction of
				grant applications.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>💰 Subscription fees are not capped</b> allowing subscribers - inlcuding foundations - to
				donate as much as they want.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🌈 Joining forces is essential</b> since sending a newspaper alone is junk mail while sending
				it together is a movement.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>🔎 Ink on paper increases attention</b> over pixels on a screen, allowing you to deliver messages
				more effectively.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Since the minimum it takes to participate in seedling is publishing two pages every month,
			there isn't much to lose. You can probably recycle the content from your website anyway!
